## Description
As a team, the general concensus was to design a full stack application that would implement all features of CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) and utilize all materials covering Java, Spring MVC(model-view-controller), mySQL, and JPA(java persistence API). With a video game store, a user would be able to participate as a buyer or seller.

When entering the site's landing page, or Home page, the user is prompted to login or register an account. After successfully logging in, there is a search bar that the user may use to find match video game listings of their interest. Otherwise, the user may create, or add, an item to sell. They are then prompted with a form to fill out information, such as the title, number of players, ratings, or images of the item. When the item has been successfully added, it will populate the search page where all listings are held.

For a successful transaction, a user will be able to click a button to buy the item they are interested in. The website will confirm the transaction when both users accept. The item is then removed from the search listings. Given that users will be able to fulfill roles as a buyer or seller, each instance they will be able to give and receive a rating on their experience.

There will also be an admin, whose responsibility is to ensure all listings and or interactions local to Eternity GameHub provide a friendly experience for all users and visitors of the site.

## Methodologies Used
In the process of building Eternity GameHub, we utilized agile development, where the goal as team is to produce a working product by a given deadline. The first step was to Plan, where we collaborated on an idea of what the application would encompass. We presented it to our instructors, who gave us feedback and the approval to move into the next process of designing a database design and wireframe of the website layout. After designing a schema with mySQL workbench and wireframe with figma, we moved into creating Java entities and JUnit tests to ensure a smooth, working program that interacted with the database. Lastly, we moved into the development of the actual website, where frontend designing was important in making an attractive, inviting product.
